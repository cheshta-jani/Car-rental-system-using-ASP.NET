Developed a web application for a car rental system using ASP.NET MVC architecture,  leveraging C# as the backend programming language and HTML, JavaScript, and CSS  for frontend development within Visual Studio.
The visual studio version I used was 2019.
You just need to run the WebApplication2.sln file with visual studio 19.
It have features like creating, updating, viewing and deleting customers and cars.
Then, in rent page, you can enter details for renting a car to a customer.
You can also have the option of return car for the cars rented.
I deployed my database on Azure. You can keep it local as well.
